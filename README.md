- 👋 Hi, I’m Trent.
- 👀 I’m interested in --> Java, Python, C++, and anything that is coding related.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning --> C++ and some other stuff on the side.
- 💻 I like learning how to code and I think github could be a good horizon to learn more.
     I don't know much about github but I hope to get a better understanding of it throughout this year
