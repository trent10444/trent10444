- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Trent.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in --> Java, Python, C++, and anything that is coding related.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning --> C++ and some other stuff on the side.
- ðŸ’» I like learning how to code and I think github could be a good horizon to learn more.
     I don't know much about github but I hope to understand more in time.
